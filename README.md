# v7userland
Port of the V7 Userland to Linux

This collection does'nt contain all of the UNIX tools (yet). This is because,
UNIX employed alot of weird hacks, so, it doesn't fit onto Linux.

If you are interestet in such source code, not contained in this tool collection, you
can obtain a copy of unix V7 sources here: http://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7

# compile

```
mkdir bin
make
```
